              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Climate Change:</strong> Nepal, like many other regions globally, is witnessing the impacts of climate change. The rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and altered precipitation patterns create conducive conditions for the rapid spread of wildfires. As vegetation dries up, the risk of ignition and the intensity of fires increase.
